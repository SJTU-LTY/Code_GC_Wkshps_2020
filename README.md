Part of the simulation results have been published on GC-Wkshps 2020, DOI: 10.1109/GCWkshps50303.2020.9367450 [1], and IEEE JSAC, DOI: 10.1109/JSAC.2022.3145914 [2].

The zero padding and random interleaver are considered in the code. These issues are not considered in [1] but in [2]. 

Please cite the above papers in you use these codes, thank you.
